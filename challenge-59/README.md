# Sort Colors

This problem was asked by Apple.

## Description

Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library’s sort function for this problem.

Can you do it in a single pass?

## Example

```
Input:  [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
```
