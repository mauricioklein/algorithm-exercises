# First and Last Indices of an Element in a Sorted Array

This problem was asked by AirBNB.

## Description

Given a sorted array, A, with possibly duplicated elements, find the indices of the first and last occurrences of a target element, x. 

Return -1 if the target is not found.

## Example

```
Input: A = [1,3,3,5,7,8,9,9,9,15], target = 9
Output: [6,8]

Input: A = [100, 150, 150, 153], target = 150
Output: [1,2]

Input: A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,10], target = 9
Output: [-1, -1]
```
