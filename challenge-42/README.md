# Depth of a stringified binary tree

This problem was asked by Linkedin.

## Description

You are given a binary tree in a peculiar string representation. Each node is written in the form (lr), where l corresponds to the left child and r corresponds to the right child.

If either l or r is null, it will be represented as a zero. Otherwise, it will be represented by a new (lr) pair.

Given this representation, determine the depth of the tree.

## Example
```
Input: ((00)(00))
Output: 2
```
